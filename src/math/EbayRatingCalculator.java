/*
 *  If a seller get x good ratings and y bad ratings, what will the possibility be that this is a bad seller.
 *  
 *  Suppose a buyer has no idea whether a seller is good (G) or bad (B), and models this by assuming that there 
 *  is a 50% chance the seller is bad. Suppose a bad seller cheats buyers 30% of the time. A good seller never 
 *  cheats buyers, but buyers might still have a bad experience with the seller 1% of the time due to circumstances 
 *  outside the seller’s control—the package really was lost in the post, for example. (We’ll assume that no such 
 *  additional causes occur with the bad seller, so that you have a bad experience with the bad seller only if he 
 *  is cheating you.)
